# Arduino coupling with Unity

## What did I do?

the objective of this code is to couple Arduino joystick to an unity game, the code is not perfect but it works.

## What were the complications?

* To let it work I hard coded on witch COM port it got on but with Codebender (the tool i use for the Arduino) changes every time I re-add the Arduino.
* In unity under the project settings / player the API Compatibility Level must be set at NET 2.0 or else it did not work for me.

## What tools did I use?

for Arduino an easy site named Codebender.

for C# I use MonoDevelop.
