# Arduino coupeling with Unity

## What did i do?

the objective of this code is to couple arduino joystick to an unity game, the code is not perfect but it works.

## What were the complications?

* To let it work I hard coded on wich COM port it got on but with codebender (the tool i use for the arduino) changes every time I re-add the arduino.
* In unity under the project settings / player the api Copatibility Level must be set at NET 2.0 or els it did not work for me.

## What tools did I use?

for arduino an easy site named Codebender.

for C# i use MonoDevelop.
